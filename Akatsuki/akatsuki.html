    <img class="pain-description-image" src="https://cmsapi-frontend.naruto-official.com/site/api/naruto/Image/get?path=/naruto/import/images/naruto02/501%EF%BD%9E600/567/C116.jpg" alt="">
    <p class="pain-description">Yahiko was orphaned during the Second Shinobi World War, forcing him to steal food in order to survive prior to teaming up with a fellow war orphan named Konan. Soon after they found a place to call home, Yahiko expressed his displeasure from Konan bringing another war orphan, Nagato, into the group.</p>
    <p class="pain-description2">Yahiko was a kind and caring person who wanted to create a world where no one would have to suffer the same fate as him. He was determined to protect his friends and create a better future for them.However, Yahiko eventually accepted Nagato and his dog Chibi into his group. Angered by how unfair the world was to them.</p>
    <p class="pain-description3">During their time with Jiraiya, he created a defence system so they could protect themselves, should enemy ninja find their hideout. It was comprised of four planks, each with one red side and one white which had a frog picture on it. The four planks were attached to a part of a wall of the hideout with their names underneath each respective plank (Nagato's on the left, Yahiko's in the middle and Konan's on the right while Jiraiya's was on a separate wall). The purpose of the planks was a defence mechanism: if one of them were in the hideout they would simply turn their plank to the red side. If for some reason the red plank was turned yet the person was not there it could alert the others that that member had been kidnapped. If one of them were to leave the hideout they would simply have to flip their plank to the white side. If it should happen that a plank is turned on to the white side yet the person is in the hideout it could mean that an enemy has transformed into said person and has infiltrated the hideout. Jiraiya had also built a trapdoor hidden among the floorboards leading to an hidden room and emergency escape route, just in case.Among the three orphans, Yahiko seemed to act as the leader of the group. It was Yahiko who first approached the Sannin to ask for food, and was the first to ask Jiraiya to teach them ninjutsu.</p>

      <h1 class="konan-head">The Angel Of Amegakure: KONAN</h1>
      <p class="konan-description">Konan was a member of the Akatsuki and one of its founding members. She was known for her paper-based jutsu and her ability to create origami constructs. Konan was a loyal friend to Yahiko and Nagato, and she played a key role in the Akatsuki's early days.</p>
      <p class="konan-description2">When she was young, Konan's family was killed during the Second Shinobi World War, and she was left to fend for herself.[4] Some time later, Yahiko found her, and the two worked together to survive. Not long after that, Konan went for a walk and found a young, dying Nagato and his dog, Chibi. She rescued him and brought him back to their hideout. Gradually the three became best friends. They eventually encountered the Sannin, who gave them some food. Konan impressed them by making an elaborate flower out of the paper wrappers left behind as a sign of gratitude. When Orochimaru suggested to kill them so they would not have to suffer the horrors of war, Jiraiya instead opted to stay and teach the three how to look after themselves.</p>
